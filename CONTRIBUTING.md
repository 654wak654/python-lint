## Checkin

- Do checkin source
- Do not checkin devDependency pipenv
- Do not checkin IDE files

## devDependencies

The project dependencys are in [docker image](https://github.com/ricardochaves/python-lint-image).

## entrypoint

Keep [entrypoint.sh](../entrypoint.sh) readable. The idea is that everyone can read, even those who don't know much about shell script.
